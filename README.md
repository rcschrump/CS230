<b>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</b> 
The Gaming Room is a client seeking to expand their game, "Draw It or Lose It," from an Android app to a web-based application serving multiple platforms. They requested a software design that supports multiple teams and players, ensures unique game and team names, and utilizes efficient memory management. Throughout the documentation, I effectively summarized the client's requirements, identified design constraints, and provided recommendations for platform selection and development tools.
<b>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</b>
In developing this documentation, I focused on clarity and conciseness, ensuring that each section addressed the client's needs comprehensively. Breaking down the client's requirements into clear sections helped in structuring the document logically and ensuring all aspects were covered.
<b>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</b>
The process of working through the design document provided a clear roadmap for developing the code. It helped in identifying potential challenges early on and devising strategies to address them. By thoroughly analyzing the requirements and considering various design options, I could make informed decisions during the coding process.
<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b>
If I could revise one part of my work on these documents, I would improve the evaluation section by providing more detailed analysis and comparisons of development tools for each operating platform. This would offer a deeper insight into the considerations involved in selecting the most appropriate tools for the project.
<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b>
Interpreting the user's needs involved carefully analyzing the client's requirements and considering factors such as scalability, usability, and security. Implementing these needs into the software design ensured that the final product would meet the client's expectations and provide a satisfactory user experience. Considering the user's needs is crucial in designing software because it ultimately determines the success and adoption of the product. By prioritizing user satisfaction, we can create software that fulfills its intended purpose effectively and earns user trust and loyalty.
<b>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</b>
In approaching software design, I utilized a systematic approach, starting with requirements analysis, followed by architectural design, and then detailed design and implementation. Techniques such as UML modeling, design patterns, and consideration of non-functional requirements helped in designing a robust and scalable software application. In the future, I would continue to employ these techniques and also emphasize user feedback and iterative development to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with user needs.
